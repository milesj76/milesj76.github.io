My goal is always to build something that works well and fulfills business needs effectively. While solving code type problems is my main interest, I also enjoy trying to improve how end users will see and use my work. It&#39;s great to not only have strong programmatic solutions but to have an organized and understandable presentation that helps guide the user. It&#39;s been quite fun to learn about the many problems that need to be solved when creating all kinds of tech.</p> <img src="${u}" alt="Headshot of Miles" class="w-60 h-min rounded-full"/></article> <article class="svelte-1yzsysc"><p class="svelte-1yzsysc">Most of my work has been created using JavaScript, Node.js and different frameworks including React and Svelte. By far, I&#39;ve enjoyed using Svelte and really hope it becomes more widely adopted. Sveltekit and Next.js have been great additions to my toolkit. I love to use Tailwindcss to speed up the styling process.</p></article> <article class="svelte-1yzsysc"><p class="svelte-1yzsysc">It has been an endless challenge as a self-taught developer over the past three or four years to learn to develop software. What I&#39;ve been most eager about lately is collaborating on larger projects with developers of a higher level. I&#39;m certainly proud that I&#39;ve managed to break through the frustrations of getting stuck on projects by myself. What I want to grow myself further is to see more of how others work and how I can better improve at building things that are easier to maintain over time.
